Main problem is I like to connect my phone to TV/projector using a HDMI/MHL cable, and whenever I do this, Firefox gets a white layer over 90% of the screen, usually a corner is all that is visible (on phone, can see 100% on TV/projector) but because it’s on the phone I can not click on anything like full screen or play or whatever i’m doing. Doesn't happen with ANY other app or game I connect with, only Firefox. To watch stuff I unfortunately have to use chrome and get battered by many intrusive popups every page press which Firefox blocks. Wish I could use this app permanently but I just can’t when connecting to a HDMI/MHL cable which is weird :/",null,2018-02-26T06:28:31Z,2018-02-26T06:24:27Z,"en","2",2,false
