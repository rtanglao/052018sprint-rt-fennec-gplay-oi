I do not have the time to wait on your browser. Over the years I keep coming back, but your browser continues to be terribly slow. 174mb? Bloatware? I gave firefox another try, as I am a big supporter, but when it falls so short on crucial things. Not on an under powered device or slow internet. Pages load slow on all my devices. I cannot find a way to make pages load in the background. I open a tab in the background and when I finally go to it, then it starts to load. What a joke. Developer suggestions, were how I use my browser, therefore no help. Very long time Firefox user, but this is unacceptable. Surprised you have space in Mobile with this atrocious browser. Mozilla fail! Dolphin browser is so much faster. I would rather be running firefox, but the load speed is unacceptable. I value my time more than that. Please don't fail me on desktop. I am trying to hold on. This is mobile therefore screen real estate is crucial, but firefox has an unnecessarily giant address bar with tons of wasted space. FAIL! Black background with White/gray text. Helps save power and reduce eye strain. There is an add on, but the page loads twice(original then inverted colors) which makes your slow program even slower. Reduce the size of your (not)awesome bar. Screen real estate is essential. You should not have to be informed of this.
